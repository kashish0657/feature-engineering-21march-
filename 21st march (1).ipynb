    "Ordinal encoding and label encoding are both techniques used to convert categorical\n",
    "variables into numerical values, which can be easier for machine learning algorithms\n",
    "to process. However, they are used in different scenarios and have some key differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label Encoding:\n",
    "Label encoding involves assigning a unique numerical label to each category in a\n",
    "categorical variable. The order or relationship between the categories is not taken \n",
    "into account. This method is typically used for nominal variables (variables with no inherent order).\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "Category\tLabel\n",
    "Red\t          0\n",
    "Blue\t      1\n",
    "Green\t      2\n",
    "Yellow\t      3\n",
    "Purple\t      4\n",
    "Label encoding is simple to implement and can work well with algorithms that can\n",
    "handle ordinal data or where the order doesn't matter. However, it may introduce\n",
    "unintended ordinal relationships in some algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding:\n",
    "Ordinal encoding, on the other hand, is used when the categorical variable has a \n",
    "clear ordinal relationship or meaningful order. In this method, each category is\n",
    "assigned a numerical value based on its order or rank. This encoding preserves the\n",
    "inherent order of the categories. For example, consider an \"Education Level\" variable:\n",
    "Category\tOrdinal Value\n",
    "High School\t      1\n",
    "Bachelor's\t      2\n",
    "Master's\t      3\n",
    "PhD\t              4\n",
    "Ordinal encoding is useful when there is a logical progression or ranking among\n",
    "categories. This encoding can capture the ordinal information and may improve the\n",
    "performance of algorithms that consider the order of the values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Suppose you are working on a dataset related to customer feedback on a product.\n",
    "One of the features is \"Satisfaction Level,\" which has categories like \"Very Dissatisfied,\"\n",
    "\"Dissatisfied,\" \"Neutral,\" \"Satisfied,\" and \"Very Satisfied.\" In this case, you could choose\n",
    "ordinal encoding because the categories have a clear ordinal relationship, and the order of\n",
    "satisfaction levels matters. You would assign numerical values based on the satisfaction \n",
    "ranking to capture this information accurately.\n"

    "Encode Categories: Replace the original categorical values with the calculated\n",

    "encoding scheme on the categorical variables in the test dataset. Replace the\n",
    "original categorical values with the corresponding calculated statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using Target Guided Encoding, the model can learn how different categories\n",
    "of a categorical variable are related to the target variable, potentially\n",
    "leading to improved predictive performance.\n"
